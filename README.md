Predicting student scores of a test using Linear Regression (My first ML project)

Author: Daniel Daramola  
Date: October 2025  

## 📘 Project Overview
This is my first machine learning project.  
The goal of this project is to predict test scores of students based on the number of hours they studied using **Linear Regression**.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset was created manually for learning purposes:

| Hours_Studied | Score |
|---------------|-------|
| 1 | 12 |
| 2 | 25 |
| 3 | 32 |
| 4 | 40 |
| 5 | 50 |
| 6 | 55 |
| 7 | 65 |
| 8 | 72 |
| 9 | 80 |
| 10 | 90 |

## Model Summary
A simple linear regression model was trained to identify the relationship between study hours (independent variable) and test scores (dependent variable).

### Results:
- **Mean Squared Error:** 4.78  
- **Visualization:** Scatter plot showing actual vs predicted values.

## Output
After running the script, you’ll see a scatter plot of actual scores (blue dots) and the predicted regression line (red line).
## 📈 Visualization
The scatter plot below shows the actual vs predicted scores:
